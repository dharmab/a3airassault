# ArmA 3: Tango Hunt

Tango Hunt is a procedurally generated scenario. The objective is for the players to clear an area of enemies. Random elements ensure that no two playthroughs are the same. Website, source code, PBO files, documentation and bug tracker at https://github.com/dharmab/a3tangohunt 

## Features 

* Randomization of most mission parameters, including the location, the number of enemies and their weapons, enemy locations and AI behaviors, time of day, weather and more. Play a dozen times and adapt to a dozen different situations. 
* Difficulty scales to the number of players. Play with two people and you'll fight a small force. Play with ten and you'll have a huge firefight with multiple enemy squads. 
* Most random elements are customizable through mission parameters. Think you can handle more enemies? Want to fight at night or in a storm? Crave some urban or vehicle combat? All of these and more can be customized to your skill level and preferences. 
* Selectable factions and loadouts. Choose from Grenadier, Automatic Rifleman, Antiarmor Specialist, Designated Marksman and Combat Medic and all of the Arma 3 factions, plus popular mods. 
* Spectator mode (powered by F3 spectator) 
* Zeus support 
* Compatible with popular gameplay mods.
* Open source and public domain. You are free to modify this mission to your preferences.
