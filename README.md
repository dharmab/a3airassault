ArmA 3: Tango Hunt
============

An ArmA 3 mission that generates a random firefight each time. The time of day, weather, location, and number and distribution of enemies is randomized on every playthrough. It's great fun for quick multiplayer games of 4-15 players.

How to play: Place the a3tangohunt.altis folder folder in your ArmA 3 missions folder. Open the mission the ArmA 3 mission editor and export the mission to multiplayer missions. You can then use the mission in LAN or Internet hosted or dedicated servers.

This mission uses components from [Urban Patrol Script](http://kronzky.info/ups/index.htm) and [F3](http://ferstaberinde.com/f3/en//index.php?title=Main_Page). All other scripts in this mission are released into the public domain, so feel free to use and modify them in your own missions. I place no restriction on use of these scripts. I request that you mention and link to [the GitHub page](http://www.github.com/dharmab/a3tangohunt) if possible, but this is not required. See LICENSE for more information.
